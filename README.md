## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Paper-Sleuth is an **AI-powered exam preparation agent** that automatically:
* Extracts key concepts from notes or papers,
* Generates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in the style of past exams,
* Classifies difficulty levels, and
* Presents an **interactive quiz interface** for self-testing.

The system combines **multi-agent reasoning**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and a **fine-tuned DistilBERT classifier** for difficulty tagging.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Multi-Agent Pipeline**  
  *Planner* â†’ extracts key concepts  
  *Generator* â†’ creates MCQs with LoRA-tuned Falcon/GPT-J  
  *Evaluator* â†’ DistilBERT difficulty classifier & quality filter  

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  Uses FAISS vector store to pull relevant context from uploaded lecture materials.

- **External Tools (MCP-style)**  
  Wikipedia search & calculator utilities accessible to the Generator Agent.

- **User Interface**  
  Streamlit web app: type a topic, generate a quiz, attempt MCQs and get instant scoring.

## ðŸ§  Models Used
| Model | Purpose | Reason |
|------|--------|-------|
| LoRA-tuned Falcon-7B / GPT-J | MCQ generation | Open-weights, supports parameter-efficient tuning for exam style |
| DistilBERT | Difficulty classification | Lightweight, fast inference |
| FAISS + HuggingFace Embeddings | Context retrieval | Efficient RAG for large lecture documents |
